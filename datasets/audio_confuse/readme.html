					Stimuli and Experiment
				</h2>
				Audio EEG Emotion Database is an emotional EEG Database that induces subjects to produce confused and non-confused emotions 
				through different types of Audios, and collects corresponding EEG signals.
				The experimental paradigm used in this database is shown in the Fig:
				<br>
				<img src="./resource/img/experiment.gif" />
				<br>
				<br>
				Subjects in each experiment need to listen to some audios, each section of the audio recording for a trial, 
				before the start of each trial first present the fixation point, it reminds the subjects that an audio is about to be played.
				 The audio starts playing 1 second after the fixation point appears. Then the subjects began to answer questions, 
				 answer this question time is set to 5 second, After the subjects answered the questions or lasted more than 5 seconds, 
				 the next trial began. According to the content of audio, it can be divided into word experiment, 
				 sentence experiment and paragraph experiment. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2 style="color: #1293EE;">
					Subjects
				</h2>
				14 subjects’ EEG data were recorded in the database, but one of them had a problem with the data label, 
				so there were only 13 subjects is valid data. Their ages ranged from 21 to 35 years old (Mean=24.5, Standard Deviation=3.84),
				including 5 males and 8 females. All the subjects have bachelor’s degree or above, including 3 undergraduate students, 
				7 master’s degree students and 3 doctor’s degree students. All the subjects are right-handed, 
				without intellectual or hearing impairment, and all of them are Chinese.
				<br>
				<br>

					Dataset Summary
				</h2>
				The Dataset consists of two parts:
				In the "Preprocessed_EEG" folder, there are files that contain downsampled, preprocessed and segmented versions of the EEG data in MATLAB (.mat file). 
				The data was downsampled to 200 Hz. A bandpass frequency filter from 0 - 75 Hz was applied. 
				We extracted the EEG segments that correspond to the duration of each movie. 
				There were a total of 45 files with the extention .mat (MATLAB files), one per experiment. 
				Each subject performed the experiment three times with an interval of approximately one week. 
				Each subject file contains 16 arrays. Fifteen arrays contain segmented preprocessed EEG data of 15 trials in one experiment (eeg_1~eeg_15, channel×data). 
				Array name labels contain the label of the corresponding emotional labels (-1 for negative, 0 for neutral and +1 for positive). 
				The detailed order of the channels is included in the dataset. 
				The EEG cap according to the international 10 - 20 system for 8 channels is shown below:
