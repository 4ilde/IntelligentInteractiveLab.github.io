					Stimuli and Experiment
				</h2>
				We use the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices as a visual stimulus for the participants, containing 48 reasoning questions. 
				
				The experiment is shown in the Fig:
				<img src="./resource/img/collection.png" class="img-fluid"">
	
				Participants have 15 seconds to answer each question  within the answering time, they need to press the key corresponding to 
				the question option preset in the program to complete the question, and then automatically enter the answering link of the 
				next question. After all 48 reasoning questions are answered, the experiment ends.We simultaneously record the participants' 
				facial video, screen content video, and eye gaze data during question answering. In addition, we mark the time stamps and 
				frame sequences at the beginning and end of each question, which can be used to segment the video and eye gaze data to form 
				participants' independent data about each question.

					Dataset Summary
				</h2>
				In the RavenGaze dataset from 34 participants, 18 women and 16 men, 22 wear glasses during the experiment and 12 do not.
				Data are collected under well-lighted indoor conditions. The answering time of each participant is 8 to 11 minutes. 
				Excluding the data of 3 participants due to incomplete data, the total duration of the facial video in the entire dataset
				is 309 minutes (30Hz), with a total of 556,476 frames of facial images. And the resolution of each face image is 640×480.
